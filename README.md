# **Foundation of AI Project üöÄ‚òÑÔ∏è**

This project aims to classify near-earth objects (NEOs) as hazardous or non-hazardous using machine learning techniques. The analysis leverages features such as relative velocity, miss distance, and absolute magnitude to train a RandomForestClassifier. The project emphasizes handling class imbalance and optimizing model generalization while avoiding overfitting.

Key steps include feature engineering to remove redundant or irrelevant data, scaling features for uniformity, and addressing class imbalance using class weighting. The final model achieved a test accuracy of 79% with balanced precision and recall, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.

This repository includes code for data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation. The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and thoughtful handling of class imbalance to ensure robust predictions for complex datasets like those used in this project.
